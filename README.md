# Ticket upgrade prediction - Warsaw Econometric Challenge Hackathon

### Hackathon task description
Predicting the willingness of passengers of the Polish Airlines &quot;LOT&quot; towards upgrading their
trip. An additional objective was to determine the optimal date for sending out an informational
message through digital channels (sms, email, app push) addressed to passengers with active
reservations who have not yet started their journey concerning the possibility of upgrading their
flight class. The study used data from the Polish Airlines &quot;LOT&quot; database. The XGBoost model
was used for prediction, to which Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and feature choice with
forward selection were applied. The data was analyzed and cleaned to determine the most optimal
forecast configuration. The solution used offers high prediction accuracy, and was interpreted using
graphs. Binary classification results confirm the significant positive effect of flight distance on LOT
Polish Airlines passengers&#39; propensity to upgrade their travel.
